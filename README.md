<h1> ML-Cluster-Classification </h1>
<p align="justify"> <b><i>DISCLAIMER:</i></b> This project was solely developed by myself for the class of Optimization and Machine Learning, for the module of Machine Learning. I haven't translated any of the comments in code, as they were a lot. There are multiple things throughout the whole project that need optimization, as well as others that need minor corrections. Some errors might occur in the code due to path changes. 

Overall the code does what was initial intended, on the Description you will be able to find some of the main objectives and results.
